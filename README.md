# Prompting ChatGPT in MNER: Enhanced Multimodal Named Entity Recognition with Auxiliary Refined Knowledge
Here are code and dataset for our Findings of EMNLP 2023 paper: [Prompting ChatGPT in MNER: Enhanced Multimodal Named Entity Recognition with Auxiliary Refined Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12212)

# Usage
PGIM is based on [AdaSeq](https://github.com/modelscope/AdaSeq), AdaSeq project is based on Python version >= 3.7 and PyTorch version >= 1.8.

# Dataset
To ease the code running, you can find our pre-processed datasets at [here](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Dexter1202/PGIM/files). And the predefined artificial samples are [here](data/ManualAnnotation).


# Step 1: Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/adaseq.git
cd adaseq
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html
```

# Step 2: Copy PGIM folder into .../adaseq/examples/
```
-adaseq
---|examples
-----|PGIM
-------|twitter-15-txt.yaml
-------|twitter-17-txt.yaml
```

# Step 3ï¼šReplace the original adaseq folder with our adaseq folder
```
-adaseq
---|.git
---|.github
---|adaseq   <-- (Use our adaseq replace it)  
---|docs
---|examples
---|scripts
---|tests
---|tools
```

# Step 4: Training Model
-For Baseline:
```
	python -m scripts.train -c examples/PGIM/twitter-15.yaml
	python -m scripts.train -c examples/PGIM/twitter-17.yaml
```
-For PGIM:
```
	python -m scripts.train -c examples/PGIM/twitter-15-PGIM.yaml
	python -m scripts.train -c examples/PGIM/twitter-17-PGIM.yaml
```
